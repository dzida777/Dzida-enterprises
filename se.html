<h1> Secondary education</h1>
<p>Secondary education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also free. It is provided by general and technical secondary schools, where studies begin at the age of 15 (or 14, as part of the old education system) and last for three or four years. Most children in Bosnia start school when they are six years old and finish high school when they are eighteen or nineteen. Students who have graduated from general secondary schools (Gimnazija) get the Matura and opt to enroll in any faculty or college after passing a qualification examination given by the institution while students who graduated from technical schools get a Diploma.</p>
